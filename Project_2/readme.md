PROJECT 1

The file provided can be launched without any modifications. It will train an agent with best configuration for 400 episodes breaking the training before 400 if it reaches an average reward per episode greater than +200 on the last 100 episodes. The training will be plotted along with the number of steps per episode. You can modify the number of max episode at line 298.

The algorithm then continues by lauching 500 episodes with the trained agent. The results is then plotted, display the detail of the rewards and the moving average over 100 episodes. You can modify the number of episodes for testing at line 357, but the plot will then raises error of dimensions...

The figures obtained in the report were generated with this script by modifying the optional inputs of the train function line 340. 

Thank you for taking the time to read these information. Regards, Adrien Poujon.
