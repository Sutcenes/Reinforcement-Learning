The provided file can be ran without any modification. The four learning procedure will then launch one after the other, each for 1 000 000 steps, and plot a graph of their evolution every 100 000 steps, plus the final graph. You might expect a running time of the order of the hour.

At lines 631, 632 are two commented lines of code. You can uncomment them to play the soccer game manually or to see a random execution of a game. The display of the soccer game is a rudimental on console one.
